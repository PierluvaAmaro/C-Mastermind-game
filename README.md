## 🎮 Game Description

**Mastermind** is a code-breaking game for one player against the computer.

The program randomly generates a **secret numeric code**, and your goal is to **guess the code** within a limited number of attempts.  
After each attempt, the program provides feedback:

- **Black pegs** → Numbers that are correct **and in the right position**  
- **White pegs** → Numbers that are correct but **in the wrong position**

You win when all positions are correct!

## ⚙️ Features

- Adjustable **code length**, **number of symbols**, and **maximum attempts**
- Option to **allow or disallow duplicate digits**
- Menu-driven interface with keyboard input
- Basic **settings management**
- Simple **text-based visuals** using ASCII and cursor positioning

> Note: Some functions and features (like saving the game) are **not yet implemented** or **may not work perfectly**.  
> This project was made mainly for learning and demonstration purposes.
